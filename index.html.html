            <p class="body_txt">Three-toed sloths are arboreal mammaels, which means 'tree-dwelling'. They are known for their slow movement: they move about 6 to 8 feet a minute. They are not successful with their movement on the ground since their hind legs are weak and their long claws dig in the ground, so they would have to rely on the strength of their front legs to drag them across, and so they spend most of their days hanging upside down in trees or swimming in the waters of South and Central America. Their curved claws allow them to hang from the trees for long periods of time. They also have extra vertebrae in their neck so they are able to turn their neck about 270 degrees. They have short, flat heads and are about the size of a small dog. Although they hang in the trees daily, they come down to the ground once a day to defecate. In general, sloths are defined by how many claws they have on each front foot. Sloths can be identified as either two toed or three toed sloths.</p>

They appear to be very hariy and have long legs with round heads, small ears, and stubby tails. Instead of toes, they have three claws on both their front and hind feet. Their fur is often light brown but appears as almost a blue-green due to algae that grows in their environment. They have 8 or 9 central vertebrae. They also have poor visual and hearing activity as well as very low metabolic rates, even while active (86 to 96 degrees farenheight). Their mouths appear as though they are always smiling.</p>

Moths and insects live in the fure of the sloth, thus creating algae on their fur. This algae helps the sloth camoflouge itself easily in the troipcal rain forests of Central and South America since both the algae and the rain forests are a blue green color. This algae helps keeps the sloths predators and hunters away.</p>

                <p class="Behavior_body_txt"> The Three-Toed sloth has a limited diet of leaves, fruits, and shoots since they spend the majority of their day sleeping in the trees. Due to the fact that they have both poor hearing and vision, when they wake up in the middle of the night to eat, they are luckily able to eat whatever food is available to them. They spend the majoirty of their lives hanging from trees since they cannot walk well on the ground. They eat, sleep, and mate in the trees only coming down to the ground once a week to poop. They have three-toed clothes on both their hind and front legs, which ables them to hang so well from the trees.</p>

            <p class="body_txt">The Pale and Brown throated sloths mate seasonally while the maned sloths mate at anytime. The three-toed sloth is only able to birth one sloth at a time and this can happen every 6 months.  They tend to mate during the late summer and early fall and give birth early in the following year. Mating begins when the female lets out a loud scream. If more than one male responds to this scream, they will hang upside down from the trees and swipe at each other with their claws to see who will win the mating call. After the mother sloth gives birth, their baby will cling on to them until they are able to feed themselves. This lasts anywhere from 5 weeks to six months. Baby sloths will stay with their mother from two to four years. In most sloth species, the female matures quicker than the male and is sexually devloped by age three.</p>

The grip of a sloth is so good, that even after death, they will stay hanging on the trees, vines, or electrical lines after death.</p>
